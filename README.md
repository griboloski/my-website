  DJ Website Project – GitHub Copilot Instructions

  Project Overview:
  -----------------
  Build a custom-coded, dark-themed website for my DJ brand focused on bookings and music releases. 
  The design should be modern and professional, inspired by https://www.djhardwell.com/. Use placeholder images and text until final assets are ready.

  Requirements:
  -------------
  1. **Homepage Layout:**
     - A header with navigation links: Home, Music, Booking.
     - A hero section featuring a placeholder logo, DJ name, and a brief tagline.
     - A section for latest music releases displaying placeholder album art, track title, and description.
     - A booking section with a form (fields: name, email, message) for booking inquiries.
     - A footer with a copyright notice.

  2. **Design & Styling:**
     - Implement a dark theme using a dark background color (#121212) with contrasting accent colors (e.g., #ff4081 for links).
     - Use a modern, minimalist layout with clear sections.
     - Ensure responsiveness with CSS Flexbox (and/or Grid) and media queries.

  3. **Interactivity:**
     - Implement smooth scrolling for internal navigation links.
     - (Optional for later) Add form validation and CSS animations for transitions.

  4. **Project Structure:**
     - **index.html** – Main HTML file containing the structure.
     - **css/styles.css** – CSS file for styling.
     - **js/scripts.js** – JavaScript file for interactivity.
     - **assets/** – Folder for images (placeholder images for logo, background, album art).

  5. **Development Notes:**
     - This is a custom-coded project aimed at practicing web development skills.
     - Use placeholder content initially; later replace with final branding and images.
     - The project is hosted on GitHub, so use version control best practices.

  Instructions for Each File:
  ---------------------------
  1. **index.html:**
     - Set up a basic HTML5 structure.
     - Include a `<header>` with a navigation bar linking to “#home”, “#music”, and “#booking” sections.
     - Create a hero section (`<section id="home">`) with the DJ logo (placeholder), name, and a tagline.
     - Create a music releases section (`<section id="music">`) that includes a grid layout of music items.
     - Create a booking section (`<section id="booking">`) with a booking form.
     - Include a footer.

  2. **css/styles.css:**
     - Write global styles and reset margins/paddings.
     - Set the dark background and light text colors.
     - Style the navigation, hero section, music grid, booking form, and footer.
     - Use media queries to ensure the site is responsive.

  3. **js/scripts.js:**
     - Implement smooth scrolling for navigation links that point to internal sections.
     - Optionally add any interactive enhancements later (e.g., form validation).

  Generate the necessary code for these files accordingly, ensuring clear comments and maintainable code. This project should serve both as a professional DJ website and a learning exercise in custom web development.
